      This file would normally be rendered by a backend server. It would consume info from
      the `dist/manifest.json` generated by vue + vite, and inject the correct styles and scripts
      into the right places of this document.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this demonstration, the style and script links have been manually edited into place,
      and we'll assume that when you run `npm run build`, it will generate the same hash codes, else
      you'll have to update this document.

      Without further ado, the "app" div follows below, where we'll mount our application `Page1.vue`
      which contains an external `<img>` link, and that's all. It would be fine if the image were 
      simply broken, since it is supped to be external. But the problem is that the `js` code that is 
      loaded attempts to do an `import` of that image, and that code breaks the client, and the app 
      is not ever loaded.
